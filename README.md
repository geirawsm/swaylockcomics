# swaylockcomics
Python script to fetch the newest edition of a comic strip and use it in swaylock. *Highly* inspired by [xkcd-lock](https://github.com/angs/xkcd-lock) by [@angs](https://github.com/angs).

## Short description

This script gets the latest strip of a comic which is added on top of a pixelated screenshot of your desktop. This image is then used as a background image when running swaylock.

Comics supported:

- Calvin & Hobbes
- CommitStrip
- Dilbert
- Dinosaur Comics
- Fagprat (no)
- Get Fuzzy
- Lunch (no)
- PvP
- xkcd

&nbsp;

## Install

Easy peasy: `pip install swaylockcomics`

&nbsp;

## How to use

Run `swaylockcomics` to lock your screen with swaylock and show a random comic strip. You can also chose a specific comic and use a pixellation distort on your lockscreen instead of the blurring. Check out `swaylockcomics -h` for more info.

If you use multiple displays, the script will only place the comic strip on your primary screen.

If the script can't fetch a comic because of connection issues, it will use a previous strip from the same comic, if it can find one in the `strips`-folder.
If there is no net and no cached comic strip available, the script will use XKCD's password-strip as default.

(This seems to be OK according to [Mr. xkcd himself](https://xkcd.com/about):
>"Can we print xkcd in our magazine/newspaper/other publication?"

>"You can post xkcd in your blog (whether ad-supported or not) with no need to get my permission."

But Randall, if I'm mistaken, please let me know.)

When using xkcd, it will also get the alt-text for the image and paste it underneath the comic.
